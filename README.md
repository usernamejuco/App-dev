# The Walking Dead

## Overview
*The Walking Dead* is a post-apocalyptic series about a group of survivors struggling to find safety under a zombie pandemic. Though the show is a must watch experience, it does include overwhelmingly brutal violence throughout it's episodes.

## Plot Summary
The Walking Dead takes place after the onset of a worldwide zombie apocalypse. The zombies, referred to as "walkers", shamble towards living humans and other creatures to eat them; they are attracted to noise, such as gunshots, and to different scents, e.g. humans.

## Favorite Moment
My favorite moments is when Rick lost his queen bee wife Lori, and his spoiled brat son named Carl. Carl and Lori are my least favorite character because they are heavy weights from the story.
